Things that need to be done/ plans. Anyone can edit this

Inventory
    Add method of setting size (File toolbar on top?) ===---Done
    Add method of naming inventory (Possibly another tab in the tab window below?) ===---Done
    Create a proper UI
        Add hoverover for details like MC does ===---Done
        Add count of items in stack ===---Done
    Data retention
        table model needs to be created to hold item materials, but not Bukkit's. We need all inventory applicable items. ===---Done
            was planning on creating a MASSIVE json file read through Gson with each item's picture path for easy
            updating later===---Done
        need a custom itemstack item that holds the stack item count, name, lore, enchantment data, and other info ==---Done
        Inventory needs to be somehow serializable now, because it's better if it is built that way to start with.  ===---Done?
    Table needs to be able to drag and drop items around. this might be hard. ==---Done

Item details
    Buttons need to add color codes to current open editor (either stack name or lore)===---Done
    Item drop down will have to be able to read the full list of options somehow. Maybe a popup jlist is needed?
    Show formatted text needs to be able to convert colors to html.

Buttons
    Button manager needs to add color codes to active editor. Listeners for this on the button side are totally ready.===---Done

Code
    Not even worrying about this yet.

Warnings before export
    If an item has no name  ===---Done
    If 2 items have the same name  ===---Done

Before Release
    Add popups when elements are first selected to explain how to use them. For example, when text is formatted, they cannot
        be typed in because of API restrictions. When the checkbox is checked for the first time, this should be
        made clear to the user because no one ever reads instructions. Let's be honest.

Later->
    Save files
    Self-generating click listeners
    (Should we remove the plans that have been done?)
