Things that need to be done/ plans. Anyone can edit this

Inventory
    Add method of setting size (File toolbar on top?)
    Add method of naming inventory (Possibly another tab in the tab window below?)
    Create a proper UI
        Add hoverover for details like MC does
        Add count of items in stack
    Data retention
        table model needs to be created to hold item materials, but not Bukkit's. We need all inventory applicable items.
            was planning on creating a MASSIVE json file read through Gson with each item's picture path for easy
            updating later
        need a custom itemstack item that holds the stack item count, name, lore, enchantment data, and other info
        Inventory needs to be somehow serializable now, because it's better if it is built that way to start with.
    Table needs to be able to drag and drop items around. this might be hard.

Item details
    Buttons need to add color codes to current open editor (either stack name or lore)
    Item drop down will have to be able to read the full list of options somehow. Maybe a popup jlist is needed?
    Show formatted text needs to be able to convert colors to html. for simplicity's sake, no editing when in formatted
        mode unless we find out that it's easy

Buttons
    Need to be a little cleaner. Might not be possible though.
    Button manager needs to add color codes to active editor. Listeners for this on the button side are totally ready.

Code
    Not even worrying about this yet.
